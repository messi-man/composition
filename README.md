.NET Library that supporting Object Composition

It's a POC to implement [DCI](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data,_context_and_interaction). 

It was a fun exercise to improve my TDD and clean code skills, and to explore run-time code generation. I wouldn't use it, you can use extension methods if you want to assign differebt roles to an object instead.

Later on I learned DDD and bounded contexts, which provides a more elegant solution to implement different use-cases for the same domain imho.
